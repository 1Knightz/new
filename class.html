            <h2>Information Technology</h2>
            <p>The IT major is a complex technical science that integrates multiple programming languages, creating and developing computer systems, building and maintaining network systems, data management and analysis, and some management and information science.

It provides the technical support behind many of today's careers. Compared with Computer Science, IT personnel need to learn more professional skills such as installing computer systems, software, maintaining networks and databases.

After graduation, students can choose to become software engineers, network engineers, film and television animation designers, programmers, etc. Job market surveys show that both demand and salary levels for IT graduates are on the rise, especially given the current IT talent shortage in industry.

Students who like practical application management, software production and software maintenance, please choose this major decisively!</p>

            <h2>Computer Science</h2>
            <p>Computer Science is the theoretical and mathematical study of the use of computers. Compared with software engineering, it is more inclined to hardware technical learning. Compared to IT, computer science needs to learn more mathematics and software design.

The future career direction of the students of this major is software engineer. Can be subdivided into Product Manager, Technical Director, Quality Assurance Analyst based on personal preference. It is more suitable for students who are good at mathematics and logic and want to work in fields such as security, graphics, machine learning or artificial intelligence.

Some large companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google and some fast-growing mid-sized companies such as snapchat all need Computer Science professionals, companies will want you to write reliable code, do interesting projects or have a solid foundation in Computer Science, such as Data Structures and Algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
            <p>Software engineering is actually the practice of making software. The job search direction is similar to that of Computer Science, but there are more required engineering courses than Computer Science students. The advantage is that your engineering strength is hard enough to find a job. The point to note is that the foundation of data structures and algorithms may be relatively weak.

This major requires the use of software programming languages to analyze user needs, and design, build, and test to ultimately ensure software quality.</p>

            <h2>Business Information System</h2>
            <p>  The Business Information Systems major combines business knowledge and technology. The main course content is business data analysis, information security and information systems.

Future jobs are for business analysts related to technology development. Students engaged in this industry need to understand the company's business, elicit the company's needs, communicate with the design department on the design direction, communicate with the technical department on the development direction, and manage the business data system.

It is necessary to understand the customer and the technical department at the same time, and convey the customer's needs in a way that the technical personnel understand~ This requires extensive knowledge reserves, a patient communication mentality and a careful and thoughtful personality~</p>
